# Favorite-LeetCode-Problems

This will be a compilation of my favorite Leet Code Problems.
The solutions will primarily be in Javascript and/or C#.

My definition of favorite will be problems that give a good example of a concept, or if I am very happy with the solution.

Folder structure will be based on the Leet Code Problem #, then separate files based on the language used to solve the solution.
